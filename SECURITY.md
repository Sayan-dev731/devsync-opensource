# Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security policies and procedures for the DevSync Open Source Platform repository. Our commitment to security ensures the protection of user data, the integrity of our codebase, and the trust of our community.

## Repository Access Control

### Access Levels and Roles

| Role | Permissions | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Repository Managers** | Full access, merge privileges | Core maintainers who can merge pull requests and manage repository settings |
| **Collaborators** | Read/write access, no merge privileges | Trusted contributors who can push to branches and create pull requests |
| **Contributors** | Read access only | External developers who contribute through forks and pull requests |

### Current Repository Managers

- **Ankita Priyadarshini** ([@ankitasahoo2004](https://github.com/ankitasahoo2004)) - Founder & Frontend Dev
- **Shubham Kumar** ([@Shubham66020](https://github.com/Shubham66020)) - Founder & MERN Dev  
- **Sayan Karmakar** ([@Sayan-dev731](https://github.com/Sayan-dev731)) - Founder & Backend Dev

## Branch Protection Rules

To maintain code quality and security, the following branch protection rules must be implemented for the main branch:

### Required Setup

Repository managers should configure the following protection rules via GitHub Settings > Branches:

#### 1. Pull Request Requirements
- ✅ **Require pull request reviews before merging**
  - Require at least 1 review from repository managers
  - Require review from code owners when applicable
- ✅ **Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed**
- ✅ **Require conversation resolution before merging**

#### 2. Status Check Requirements  
- ✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
  - Configure CI/CD pipeline checks (when implemented)
  - Require security scanning checks
- ✅ **Require branches to be up to date before merging**

#### 3. Security Restrictions
- ✅ **Restrict pushes that create files that contain secrets**
  - Enable push protection for secrets
  - Configure secret scanning alerts
- ✅ **Restrict who can merge pull requests**
  - Only repository managers can merge PRs
  - Require administrator privileges for emergency merges

#### 4. Additional Protections
- ✅ **Require signed commits** (recommended)
- ✅ **Include administrators** in protection rules
- ✅ **Allow force pushes** (disabled)
- ✅ **Allow deletions** (disabled)

## Contribution Security Guidelines

### For All Contributors

1. **Code Review Process**
   - All code changes must go through pull request review
   - No direct pushes to the main branch
   - Address all security-related feedback before approval

2. **Secure Development Practices**
   - Never commit secrets, API keys, or sensitive data
   - Use environment variables for configuration
   - Follow the principle of least privilege
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information

3. **Dependencies Management**
   - Keep dependencies updated and scan for vulnerabilities
   - Use `npm audit` to check for security issues
   - Only add dependencies from trusted sources
   - Document dependency changes in pull requests

### For Repository Managers

1. **Review Responsibilities**
   - Conduct thorough security reviews of all pull requests
   - Verify that new dependencies are secure and necessary
   - Ensure branch protection rules are maintained
   - Monitor for suspicious activity or unusual access patterns

2. **Access Management**
   - Regularly review collaborator access levels
   - Remove access for inactive collaborators
   - Use two-factor authentication (2FA) for all manager accounts
   - Monitor repository access logs

## Security Reporting

### Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in the DevSync platform, please report it responsibly:

#### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities

#### 2. **DO** report security issues privately to:
- **Primary Contact**: [sayan.karmakar.dev@gmail.com](mailto:sayan.karmakar.dev@gmail.com)
- **Secondary Contact**: [ankita.sahoo.dev@gmail.com](mailto:ankita.sahoo.dev@gmail.com)

#### 3. **Include the following information**:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes or mitigation strategies
- Your contact information for follow-up

#### 4. **Expected Response Time**:
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Resolution Timeline**: Depends on severity (Critical: 7 days, High: 14 days, Medium: 30 days)

### Security Issue Categories

| Severity | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Critical** | Immediate threat to user data or system integrity | RCE, SQL injection, authentication bypass |
| **High** | Significant security impact | XSS, CSRF, privilege escalation |
| **Medium** | Moderate security concern | Information disclosure, insecure configurations |
| **Low** | Minor security issue | Security headers, minor information leakage |

## Incident Response

### In Case of Security Breach

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate affected systems if possible
   - Notify all repository managers immediately
   - Document all actions taken
   - Preserve evidence for investigation

2. **Communication**:
   - Internal team notification within 1 hour
   - User notification within 24 hours (if user data affected)
   - Public disclosure after resolution (if appropriate)

3. **Recovery**:
   - Implement immediate fixes
   - Review and update security measures
   - Conduct post-incident review
   - Update security policies as needed

## API Security

### Authentication Requirements

All API endpoints follow the security measures outlined in [API_AUTHENTICATION.md](API_AUTHENTICATION.md):

- API key authentication for programmatic access
- Session-based authentication for web access
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Proper error handling without information disclosure

### Security Headers

The application implements security headers:
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-XSS-Protection
- Strict-Transport-Security (HTTPS only)

## Compliance and Monitoring

### Regular Security Practices

- **Monthly Security Reviews**: Repository managers conduct monthly security audits
- **Dependency Updates**: Weekly automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Access Reviews**: Quarterly review of all user access levels
- **Policy Updates**: Annual review and update of security policies

### Monitoring and Alerting

- GitHub security alerts for dependencies
- Secret scanning alerts
- Unusual access pattern monitoring
- Failed authentication attempt monitoring
